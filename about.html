<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Western University with a
  keen passion for problem-solving. The more I learn, the more I realize how
  much fun it is to turn all that textbook knowledge into real-world solutions.
  And it's not just about the classroom for meâ€”I'm often diving into coding
  competitions and hackathons, eager to learn more and meet folks who share the
  same passion. Let's connect and maybe build something cool together!
